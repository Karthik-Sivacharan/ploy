# Ploy

**AI-native marketing platform** — brand, website, and multi-channel growth from one visual canvas.

Ploy collapses the 10-15 tools a marketing team juggles into a single workflow builder. Connect your brand assets, voice guidelines, and CRM audience — an AI agent generates a complete multi-channel campaign (landing page, email drip, Instagram ads, push notifications) all on-brand, from one canvas.

**Live demo:** [useploy.vercel.app](https://useploy.vercel.app)

## The Prototype

The current prototype tells the story of a **Peloton Summer Launch** campaign through 8 connected nodes on a visual canvas:

```
[Brand Assets]  ────────┐
  (Frontify)            |
                        |
[Brand Voice]  ─────────+──>  [AI Campaign Agent]  ──+──>  [Landing Page]      (Webflow)
  (Notion)              |      (Claude Opus)         |
                        |                            +──>  [Email Sequence]    (Mailchimp)
[Target Audience] ──────┘                            |
  (HubSpot)                                          +──>  [Instagram Ads]     (Meta)
                                                     |
                                                     +──>  [Push Notification] (OneSignal)
```

### Input Nodes (left)
- **Brand Assets** — Color swatches, typography, and logo from Frontify
- **Brand Voice** — Tone guidelines with Lexical rich-text editor from Notion
- **Target Audience** — HubSpot segment with 12,847 contacts, filter pills, dynamic list

### Center Node
- **AI Campaign Agent** — Claude Opus-powered brief with model selector, connected sources, and channel output pills

### Output Nodes (right)
- **Landing Page** — Webflow page preview with screenshot, slug, and staging URL
- **Email Sequence** — 3-email Mailchimp drip (Day 1/3/7) with recipient count
- **Instagram Ads** — Gemini 2.0 Flash-powered ad creative with targeting and budget
- **Push Notification** — OneSignal mobile push mockup with delivery progress bar

Every node has a **compact canvas view** and an **expanded sidebar editor** when clicked.

## Design Decisions

- **All static data** — No real API calls. Content is pre-filled to tell the Peloton campaign story.
- **Design tokens only** — No hardcoded colors. Everything uses semantic tokens (`text-foreground`, `bg-muted`, `border-border-subtle`).
- **Hugeicons only** — Single icon family across the entire app. Registered in `lib/icons.ts`.
- **Provider logos via Brandfetch** — Real brand logos fetched from CDN, with Hugeicons fallbacks.
- **Model badges via models.dev** — AI model logos (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI) from the models.dev CDN.
- **Per-node height layout** — Dagre auto-layout with height overrides per node type to prevent overlap.
